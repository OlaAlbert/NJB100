Explanation:

Imports: We import the http module for creating the server and the os module to get CPU and OS information.
Server Setup: We define the hostname (localhost) and port (3000) for the server.
createServer: The http.createServer function creates a server instance. It takes a callback function that handles incoming requests.
CORS Headers: Inside the callback function, we set CORS headers to allow requests from any origin (*). This allows access from different domains for development purposes. You might want to restrict this in production.
Handling GET Requests: We check if the request method is GET and the URL is the root path (/).
Simulating Asynchronous Operation: We use setTimeout to simulate an asynchronous operation with a random delay between 0 and 1 second.
CPU and OS Info: Inside the timeout, we gather CPU information (number of cores and model) and OS information (platform and release) using the os module.
Response: We set the response status code to 200 (OK), set the content type to JSON, and send the information as a JSON object.
404 Not Found: For any other request method or URL, we send a 404 Not Found response.
Server Listen: We use server.listen to start the server on the specified hostname and port. It also logs a message indicating where the server is running.
Running the Server:

Save the code as a file (e.g., server.js).
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
Run the server using node server.js.
You can test the server using tools like Postman or by making a GET request to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser. The response will be a JSON object containing CPU and OS information after a random delay.
